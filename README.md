# YouVector

During my period of freelance graphic designer, I was designing icons, logos and various vector illustrations for clients from all over the world.
Recently, I had the idea of opening an online design shop where users could buy my illustrations with crypto currencies.<br>
This website is a pixel-perfect conversion from a template I designed.
